This repository and its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are
two key components of a Dads Against Deworming Analysis (DAD) on the costs and
benefits of mass deworming interventions in various settings. Together,
these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis to
facilitate collaboration and discussion about deworming policy.

1 - [An interactive plot](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/),
which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given
set of assumptions. Materials can be found in:
[`code/shiny_app`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/tree/master/code/shiny_app).

2 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials
necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.
